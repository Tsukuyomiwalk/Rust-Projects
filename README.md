# README.md for My R&D Projects

This repository contains several research and development projects covering various topics. Each project is briefly described below, along with its main objectives and purpose.

## Project 1: Command Line Utility for File Intersection

### Description
In this project, we have developed a command-line utility that takes two input files and outputs all the lines that are common to both files. Each unique line found in the intersection of the files is displayed only once in the output. The order of output lines is not specified.

## Project 2: Two-Dimensional Percolation Problem

### Description
This project addresses the probabilistic solution of the two-dimensional percolation problem. Given the width, height, and the probability of each cell being vacant, the goal is to estimate the probability of a randomly generated field allowing a path from any cell at y == 0 to any cell at y == height - 1 (if such a path exists). The path is defined as a sequence of cells where the Manhattan distance between adjacent cells is exactly 1.

## Project 3: PaperIO Bot

### Description
In this project, we've created a bot for the game PaperIO. The bot is designed to play the game autonomously and make strategic decisions to maximize its territory while avoiding collisions with other players.

## Project 4: Polka Programming Language Interpreter

### Description
This project involves the implementation of an interpreter for the Polka programming language. Polka is a toy programming language with a simplified syntax. The interpreter can execute Polka programs, making it a useful tool for educational purposes and lightweight scripting.

## Project 5: INI File Parser

### Description
In this project, we've developed an INI file parser. INI files are a common configuration file format. The parser can read and extract data from INI files, making it easier to work with configuration settings in various applications.

## Project 6: The Evolution of Trust Game Simulator

### Description
This project is centered around creating a simulator for the game "The Evolution of Trust." The game explores strategies of cooperation and betrayal in iterative prisoner's dilemma scenarios. The simulator allows you to experiment with different strategies and study the outcomes.

Each project is contained in its respective directory within this repository and comes with its own documentation and source code. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use these projects for research and development purposes. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.
